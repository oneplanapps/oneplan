### `Initial Release`

# **Version 1.0**

Put your training plan in the palm of your hand. Whether you're training for your first 5K or just want to schedule your regular training sessions, Oneplan lets you enter your own plan or amend a preset plan to schedule and tick off your training sessions, around your busy schedule. Your plan, your way!

## **Version 2.0**

Version 2.0, or a complete OnePlan relaunch. After releasing version 1.0, we've taken all of the feedback we could get and went back to the drawing board. We've added features, squashed some bugs and launched the Android version of OnePlan (not yet approved by the store at the time of writing this)

Edit: Android is now released!
